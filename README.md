📌 Project Overview: Trendies Notification System
This project was built as a technical assignment for a senior full-stack developer role at Trendies, a curated luxury resale marketplace. The goal was to demonstrate the design and implementation of a modular notification system with real-time frontend updates and simulated email delivery via Brevo.

I completed this build in under two days, using a combination of Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Mantine UI, and mock backend logic. I used AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT to generate boilerplate where helpful, but took a senior-level approach in reviewing, structuring, and extending the codebase to ensure clarity, modularity, and maintainability.

This submission simulates key lifecycle events, supports real-time notification display, and includes a simple admin dashboard for managing and filtering system events.

🤝 My Approach
While I don’t yet hold a formal senior title, my process reflects a senior mindset:

I broke down vague requirements into modular, testable components

I prioritized clarity over cleverness and designed for easy future extension

I used AI intentionally to reduce boilerplate, but focused on clean architecture and real-world logic

I built both user-facing and admin-facing flows, with attention to UI polish, state management, and event flow

All backend logic is simulated using in-memory mock data and realistic async event flows. The structure is intentionally database-ready, while remaining lightweight and easy to extend.

📝 Notes & Assumptions
Emails are simulated only (no real sending, logs to console) via Brevo mock API structure

No persistent storage is used (data resets on reload)

All events are triggered manually or through mock timers

The UI follows Trendies’ branding guidelines where available (via provided Figma references)

🧑‍💻 Final Thoughts
This system was designed and built to show how I approach full-stack problems with a product mindset, clean architecture, and strong attention to UX. It’s compact, testable, and ready to grow — just like I am as a developer.
